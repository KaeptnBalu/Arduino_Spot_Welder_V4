This is the V4.0.3 Arduino Code for the Arduino Spot Welder.

Improvements:
 - updated the menue structure 
 - added weld activation sound 
 - added a sound in auto pulse mode when both welding tips touch the nickel
 - sound can be switched on and off in the menue

After updating to this version please perform a "Full Reset" in the system menue of the welder to ensure proper functionality.
