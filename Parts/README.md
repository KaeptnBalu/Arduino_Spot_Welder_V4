For a complete parts list take a look at the BOM file

These are the parts you need to buy for building the Spot Welder V4 from scratch. With the Mouser.com Shop Link you can directly ad all electronic component parts to your shopping cart.

Not included in the Mouser shopping cart:

    1x Arduino Nano
    1x OLED Display

Parts I bought at the local hardware store:

    1x piece of 15x1000mm aluminium about 3 or 4mm thick (you only need 180mm for to make the two aluminum parts)
    Some 16mmÂ² cable and short piece of thick solid copper wire for the welding cables and welding tips

You can get ready made welding cables, aluminum parts and pcb sets at www.malectrics.eu if you dont want to make them yourself.
